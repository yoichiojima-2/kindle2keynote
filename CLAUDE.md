## abstract

this repository is for converting ebooks in pdf format into text, and eventually turn it into keynote slides with marp.

## plan

- create a program that does extract text from pdf. the extraction quality matters, so i'd like to find the best way including ai. if there is better way for this purpose not using ai, it is okay. the purpose is not to use ai but extract precise text from pdf.
- then read the text with llm and turn it into marp text.

## notice

- commit and push every now and then
